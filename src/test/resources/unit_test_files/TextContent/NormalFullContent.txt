In an updated report on the state of the small-satellite launch industry, Carlos Niederstrasser quantifies the increase in potential small launch vehicle contenders, defined as rockets capable of carrying up to 1000kg to low-Earth orbit. The growth has been remarkable. "The total number of efforts we are tracking... has increased from a mere 31 in 2015 to over 101 in 2018," he writes.
