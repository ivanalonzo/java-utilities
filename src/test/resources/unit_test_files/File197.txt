This week's test session in Barcelona will also allow McLaren to debut its Renault engine after three dismal years with Honda, and give Red Bull a chance to show it has a car fast enough to finally contend for titles again.

Most teams unveiled their cars last week, when drivers were allowed to get a first taste of action in limited outings for video filming.

Mercedes dominated the last four seasons but Lewis Hamilton faced a tough challenge from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel a year ago.

Ferrari won five races with Vettel last season, but the Italian team hasn't won a drivers' title since 2007 with Kimi Raikkonen.

Red Bull, which won four straight titles with Vettel from 2010-13, was the third force last season and at times it got extremely close to Mercedes and Ferrari.

McLaren is likely the team most anxious to get to the track after swapping from Honda to Renault, a move it hopes will end the struggles from the last few seasons, when it dealt with reliability issues and lack of power.

Last year's car was the fastest car on track  -  it won the most races and had the most pole positions.
